# Interpreter Pattern Example

This project provides an example implementation of the Interpreter pattern using C# and xUnit for unit testing.

## Overview

The Interpreter pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a language and its grammar, along with an interpreter to evaluate expressions in that language. It allows you to interpret sentences or expressions and solve a particular problem.

This project demonstrates the use of the Interpreter pattern by implementing a simple expression evaluator. It defines different types of expressions (e.g., numbers, addition, subtraction) and uses an interpreter to evaluate these expressions and produce the result.

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard C# project structure:

- `10-Interpreter pattern`: Contains the implementation of the Interpreter pattern.
- `Test`: Contains unit tests for the Interpreter pattern.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

  ```bash
  cd 10-Interpreter pattern

3.Restore the NuGet packages
  ```bash
  dotnet restore

4.Build the solution
  ```bash
  dotnet build

5.Run the unit tests:
  ```bash
  dotnet test
