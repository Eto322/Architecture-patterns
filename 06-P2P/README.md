# Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Pattern Example

This is an example project demonstrating the implementation of a simple Peer-to-Peer (P2P) pattern using Python.

The project consists of a P2PNode class that represents a peer in a P2P network. Each peer can send and receive messages to/from other peers in the network.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your machine


## Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Start the P2P node by running the following command:

   ```bash
   python p2p.py
   ```

   The P2P node will start and display the host and port it is listening on.


## Running the Tests

The project includes unit tests to verify the functionality of the P2P communication. To run the tests, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd tests
   ```

3. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover
   ```

   The unit tests will execute and display the test results.
